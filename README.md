# 🌱 Spring Learning Lab 🚀  

Welcome to **Spring Learning Lab**, a dedicated repository for exploring, practicing, and mastering various Spring-related concepts. This is a hands-on learning space covering everything from the fundamentals of Spring to advanced topics like microservices and security.  

---

## 📌 Objectives  
This repository is created to:  
- Understand the **core Spring features** like IoC, AOP, and Beans.  
- Develop **RESTful APIs** using Spring Boot.  
- Work with **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions.  
- Implement **authentication & authorization** using Spring Security and OAuth.  
- Explore **messaging systems** like Kafka & RabbitMQ.  
- Learn **testing strategies** with JUnit & Mockito.  
- Develop **microservices** using Spring Cloud components.  
- Deploy Spring applications with **Docker & Kubernetes**.

## 📖 Learning Approach  
To maximize learning, the approach will be:  
1. **Choose a Spring topic** (e.g., Spring Boot REST API).  
2. **Build small hands-on exercises** for practical learning.  
3. **Document key learnings** in the `docs/` directory.  
4. **Implement mini-projects** to gain real-world experience.  
5. **Apply best practices** and improve the code iteratively.  

Each learning topic will have:  
✅ A well-documented **README** explaining the concept.  
✅ A **working example** with step-by-step implementation.  
✅ **Code comments & best practices** for clarity.
